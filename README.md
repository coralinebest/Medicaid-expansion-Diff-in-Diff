#  Impact of Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion on Marriage and Divorce in the United States



## Overview
The study explores the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014 on marriage and divorce patterns in the United States. The Medicaid expansion, which aimed to increase health insurance coverage, may have influenced individuals' decisions regarding marriage and divorce due to risk aversion for healthcare.


## Data
The study utilizes data from Census and state-based surveys, covering the period from 2010 to 2017. Variables include ethnicity, marital status, education level, poverty rate, median household income, and employment status. The analysis focuses on 16 states that implemented Medicaid expansion as the treatment group and 34 states as the control group.

## Methodology
The difference-in-difference approach is employed to estimate the impact of Medicaid expansion on marriage and divorce stocks. Fixed effects and control variables are introduced to address state-specific factors. The study also considers the influence of low-income individuals and includes a robustness check.

## Results
The main results indicate a significant increase in the stock of marriage in states that implemented Medicaid expansion. However, there is no statistically significant evidence for the impact on the stock of divorce. Robustness checks and control variables support the reliability of the marriage stock results.

## Discussion
The article discusses the challenges of focusing on low-income individuals, the potential biases introduced by using education as a proxy for income, and the limitations of the staggered difference-in-difference model. The lack of individual-level data is identified as a constraint.
